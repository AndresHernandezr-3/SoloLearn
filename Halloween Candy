# Simple problem about a fixed value's percentage decreasing over increment in number of samples
import math #Library for mathceil

HousesVisited = int(input())    # Inputting integer >3
Dollarperc = 200/HousesVisited  # If HousesVisited = 100% then 2 Houses with dollars represent how much % (Math Rule of three)
RoundedDollar = math.ceil(Dollarperc)   #Rounding up to nearest number
print(RoundedDollar)    #Output
