# In this exercise, we are trying to find the average number of letters used per word in an essay(string)
# But also, there's a rule about not counting punctuation and to round the number up even the minimum decimal

import math
import string

essay = str(input())    #inputs the string
separatewords = essay.split()   #Separates it into words
eachwordletters = []    #Defining variable/initializing
for word in separatewords:
    if word.isalpha():
        eachwordletters.append(word)    #filtering the alphabetic characters
countedlett = [len(word) for word in eachwordletters] # This function counts the letters in each word and puts the number in an array
sumofletters = sum(countedlett) #Sums every value in the array
avgletters = sumofletters/len(separatewords)    #If you divide between number of words then it's the avg
roundedavg = math.ceil(avgletters)  #This function rounds up even the lowest decimal.
print(roundedavg)
